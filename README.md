# ImageProcessingProject2022

This project is divided into two phases:
    
* phase one -> lane line detection (path -> ImageProcessingProject2022/phase)
    ## objective:
	### 1- detect lane lines.
	### 2- measure the curvature of the road.
	### 3- measure the distance from the center lane.

    ## uploaded files:
	### 1- SIMPLE lane line detection
		    It's a simple code I created from A to Z just detecting the lane lines.
	### 2- ADVANCED lane line detection
		    I followed some projects on GitHub and modified one to work on with my project data.
	### 3- MODIFIED lane line detection
		    I tried to create a new code based on some previous projects and eliminate unwanted functions, but it's not worked, unfortunately.

	    notes: you will find some output videos are clipped to get the acceptable size of GitHub to be uploaded successfully (less than 25M).

* phase two -> vehicle detection (path -> ImageProcessingProject2022/phase two)
    ## objective:
	### 1- detect vehicles in the road.

	    notes:
	      1- you must copy your data folders (vehicles & non-vehicles) in phase two folder // I didn't upload those files because they are so large.
	      2- you will find some output videos are clipped to get the acceptable size of GitHub to be uploaded successfully (less than 25M).
