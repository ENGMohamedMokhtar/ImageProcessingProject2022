# ImageProcessingProject2022

This project is divided into two phases:
    
* Phase 1 -> lane line detection 
	- path -> ImageProcessingProject2022/phase
	
    ## Objectives:
	### 1- detect lane lines.
	### 2- measure the curvature of the road.
	### 3- measure the distance from the center lane.

    ## Uploaded Files:
	### 1- SIMPLE lane line detection
		 It's a simple code I created from A to Z just detecting the lane lines.
	### 2- ADVANCED lane line detection
		 I followed some projects on GitHub and modified one to work on with my project data.
	### 3- MODIFIED lane line detection
		 I tried to create a new code based on previous projects & eliminate unwanted functions, but it's not worked, unfortunately.

    ## Notes:
         you will find some output videos are clipped to get the acceptable size of GitHub to be uploaded successfully (> 25M).

* Phase 2 -> vehicles detection 
	- path -> ImageProcessingProject2022/phase two
	
    ## Objective:
	### 1- detect vehicles in the road.
    
    ## Notes:
	### 1- you must copy your data folders (vehicles & non-vehicles) in phase two folder
		// I didn't upload those files because they are so large.
	### 2- you will find some output videos are clipped to get the acceptable size of GitHub to be uploaded successfully (less than 25M).
