# ImageProcessingProject2022

This project is divided into two phases:
1- phase one -> lane line detection (named -> ImageProcessingProject2022/phase)
    objective:
      1- detect lane lines.
      2- measure the curvature of the road.
      3- measure the distance from the center lane.
    uploaded files:
      1- SIMPLE lane line detection
            It's a simple code I created from A to Z just detecting the lane lines.
      2- ADVANCED lane line detection
            I followed some projects on GITHUB and modified one to work on with my project data.
      3- MODIFIED lane line detection
            I tried to create a new code based on some previous projects and eliminate unwanted functions, but it's not worked, unfortunately.
